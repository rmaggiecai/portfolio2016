            | The initial onboarding flow for marketers was confusing and difficult to complete. A month after the beta launch, I redesigned the entire flow based on user feedback. Through user testing, I was able to create a comprehensive and easy process. However, due to technical resource constraints, I was limited to using existing design elements and quick fixes to meet our deadlines.

          h3 Final Design
          p The new flow allows marketers to create multiple marketing campaigns. It allows users to skip steps if desired. The final UI only compose of existing elements due to limited development time and resource.

          p
            |Our customers were having trouble completing the onboarding flow on their own because it did not align with their workflow. Based on their feedback, I redesign the flow to meet the following goals:
            ul#selector
              li Collect all the information we need from the marketer
              li Marketers have all the information that they need
              li Steps should be logically ordered and are easy to follow
            br
            |I then created low-fidelity mockups and tested them with customers & colleagues. I iterated on the flow until the above goals were met.

          h3 Navigation Redesign
          p
            |I wanted to redesign the navigation so that users can complete the process quickly and seamlessly. The navigation redesign goals were:
            ul#selector
              li A clear insight on all the steps within the process
              li Allow users to come back and complete the steps at any time
              li Allow users to navigate freely between the steps
              li Show which steps are complete and which steps are not
            br
            |I first experimented with existing UI elements. However, none of them were able to meet all the goals. I then experimented with new UI elements.
            br
            br
            |The ideal design was to use a side navigation. It clearly indicates the status of each step and it allows users to save & exit at any time.  Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t go with that design due to a lack of development time.
