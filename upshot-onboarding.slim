            | After we launched our MVP, we saw a high drop-off rate. In addition, many users did not fully understand our product offering. Within a week, I identified key areas of improvements, redesigned the most problematic step, and redesigned icons for better communication.

          h3 The Final Design

          p The goal of the redesign was to help users understand the benefits of our service and educate them on how the process works. The new design comprehensively outlines the process. It highlights the immediate steps so it is easier to read. It also explains the subsequent steps to set up proper expectations.

            |I audited the onboarding flow to identify key issues. Based on the audit, the Start Screen had the most problems:
            ul#selector
              li It did not inform users on what is expected of them
              li It did not educate users on the importance of Finding Your Story
              li The copy is not cohesive: title of the page did not match the copy below

          h3 Ideation
          p
            |I first explored two alternative paths: 1) listing each step and 2) introducing the editor to help build rapport.
            br
            br
            |We really like idea #2, but the technical complications of assigning editors were still unknown. We decided to go with idea #1. However, listing each steps is boring and hard to read. Thus, I explored various layouts using icons on our homepage.

          h3 Icon Redesign
          p
            |Some of the original icons did not help with communication. Their styles were also inconsistent. I decided to design a new set of icons.
            br
            br
            |With very little time, I searched The Noun Project to find icons based on keywords. I selected line icons that were rectangular in shape. I then tweaked them in Illustrator to create matching styles.
